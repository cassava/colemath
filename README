# README FOR COLEMAK-BM 1.0

This project is a modification (fork) of the colemak keyboard layout.

It features the following modifications and additions:

  * Inclusion of vim mappings, so that the hjkl navigation works.
    Only the keys that must be changed have been changed.

  * Inclusion of some useful math symbols into the colemak layout,
    in the form of an Xmodmap script (as it is intended for X11).

  * Change of the CAPSLOCK key from Backspace to an additional ESC
    (just for the console, as I have no need right now to set it also
    for X, because Gnome can already do it, hence X11 also).

The Xmodmap scripts are put into /usr/share/colemak along with the
picture of the colemak keyboard layout. For these to be useful, they
need to be copied into your home directory.

`Xmodmap.colemak.math` is the modification, and `Xmodmap.colemak` is
the script to return to the default Colemak configuration.
